\ptitle{PA}{Problem C}

The English language is infamous for having an inconsistent spelling system.
One feature in the spelling system that you are interested in is the usage of the letter \texttt{c}.
The letter \texttt{c} can be pronounced in multiple different ways, which might be confusing for the speaker.
However, there are some simplified patterns to help speakers determine which pronunciation to use.

\begin{itemize}
  \item It is pronounced as $\langle$k$\rangle$ if it is either: followed by \texttt{a}, \texttt{o}, or \texttt{u}; followed by a consonant letter other than \texttt{h} and \texttt{y}; or at the end of a word.
  The consonant letters are the English letters excluding the vowel letters: \texttt{a}, \texttt{e}, \texttt{i}, \texttt{o}, and \texttt{u}.
  \item It is pronounced as $\langle$s$\rangle$ if it is followed by \texttt{e}, \texttt{i}, or \texttt{y}.
  \item The pair of adjacent letters \texttt{ch} is pronounced with a unique sound $\langle$c$\rangle$.
\end{itemize}

You are given $N$ words: $S_1, S_2, \dots, S_N$.
For each given word, simplify the spelling system by replacing every occurence of \texttt{c} into \texttt{k} or \texttt{s} (for the sound $\langle$k$\rangle$ and $\langle$s$\rangle$ respectively) according to the patterns above and every occurence of \texttt{ch} into \texttt{c}.

\psection{Input}
The first line consists of an integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 100$).

Each of the next $N$ lines consists of a string $S_i$.
String $S_i$ consists of only lowercase English letters, and its length is between $1$ and $100$.


\psection{Output}
For each word, output a single line containing a string that represents the simplified spelling system of string $S_i$ according to the patterns above.
