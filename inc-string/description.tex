\ptitle{K}{Palindrome Partition}

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards as backwards. 
For example, \texttt{radar}, \texttt{noon}, and \texttt{a} are palindromes, while \texttt{bathtub}, \texttt{thought}, and \texttt{is} are not.

Given a string $S$ consisting only of lowercase English letters. 
You can rearrange the letters in $S$ in any order you like. 
Your task is to split $S$ after rearrangement into as few palindromic substrings as possible.

\psection{Input}

The first and only line contains the string $S$ ($1 \le |S| \le 200\;000$) containing lowercase English letters.

\psection{Output}

On the first line, print the minimum number $k$ of palindrome substrings.

On the next $k$ lines, print the palindromes that the string $S$ (after rearrangement) can be split into.
If there are multiple ways to split, you may output any of them.

\textit{Explanation of Sample 1:} We can rearrange the input string into \texttt{levelracecar}, then split the string into two palindromes: \texttt{level} and \texttt{racecar}. No rearrangement can produce a single palindrome, so the minimum number of palindromes is $2$.
