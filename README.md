# Indonesia National Contest 2025 - Problem Repository

## Repository Structure

Each problem (from PA to PD for trial and A to L for contest) has their own folder. The folder name is the `slug` of the problem, which is the codename we used when we internally prepare the problems. The following table describes the slug for each problem

| Problem Code | Problem Slug   | Problem Title             |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| PA           | incp-problem   | Problem C                 |
| PB           | incp-treasure  | Treasure Lair             |
| PC           | incp-creator   | Graph Director            |
| PD           | incp-median    | ICPC Provincial           |
| A            | inc-osn        | National Science Olympiad |
| B            | inc-bfs        | Construct BFS Graph       |
| C            | inc-polynomial | Polynomially Constructed  |
| D            | inc-divido     | Divido Travel             |
| E            | inc-xordition  | Xordition Robot           |
| F            | inc-rate       | Food Rating               |
| G            | inc-mex        | Mex XOR                   |
| H            | inc-light      | Light Control System      |
| I            | inc-pool       | Rectangular Pool          |
| J            | inc-mediation  | Mediation                 |
| K            | inc-string     | Palindrome Partition      |
| L            | inc-arrays     | Honourable Arrays         |

In the problem folder, there should have the following file/folder:

- `description.tex`. The raw TeX file to generate the PDF problem statement. The template for each `.tex` file is available in the `problem-templates` folder.
- `description.pdf`. The problem statement distributed to the contestants during the contest.
- `tc/`. A folder consisting of the test cases generated by `spec.cpp`.
- `solution.cpp`. The official solution used to generate the outputs of the testcases
- `scorer.cpp` (if exists). A validator used to validate contestants' output. The code accepts three arguments.
  - The first parameter will be used as the filename of the input file
  - The second parameter will be used as the filename of the judge's output file
  - The third parameter will be used as the filename of the contestant's output file
  - This code will print `WA` to stdout if the contestant's output is intended to be judged `WRONG ANSWER`, while it will print `AC` to stdout if the contestants's output is intended to be judged `CORRECT`.

## Limitations

The following table describes the time and memory limit for each problem.

| L            | 4 sec      | 2048 MB      |

## Solutions

Note that while there is only one official published solution, we have a lot of other solutions prepared for our internal testing. These other solutions include, but not limited to:

- Solutions in several other languages
- Solutions that is intended to be incorrect (e.g. WA, TLE, etc.)
- Other correct solutions (especially on problems with more than one correct outputs for each input)

## Additional Notes

The problemset was officially deployed by the judges on [TLX](https://tlx.toki.id/problems/inc-2025).
