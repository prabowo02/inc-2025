\ptitle{B}{Construct BFS Graph}

You are currently researching a graph traversal algorithm called the Breadth First Search (BFS).
Suppose there is a graph of $N$ nodes, numbered from $1$ to $N$, and an adjacency matrix $A$, for which node $u$ can traverse to node $v$ if $A_{u, v}$ is $1$, otherwise it is $0$.
The following pseudocode will output the order the nodes that are visited in a BFS algorithm.

\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{verbatim}
    BFS(A[1..N][1..N]):
        let U be an empty array
        let Q be an empty queue

        append 1 to U
        push 1 to Q

        while Q is not empty:
            pop the front element of Q into u
            for v = 1 to N:
                if A[u][v] == 1 and v is not in U:
                    append v to U
                    push v to Q

        return U
\end{verbatim}
\vspace{-3mm}

Suppose now you have an integer $N$, $M$, and an array $U$ of $N$ integers.
You wonder whether there exists a simple undirected graph with $N$ nodes and $M$ edges such that the output of the pseudocode above is the array $U$.
Construct such graph if it exists.

A simple undirected graph with $M$ edges has an adjacency matrix $A$ that satisfies the following.

\begin{itemize}
  \item $A_{u, u} = 0$ for all $1 \leq u \leq N$.
  \item Exactly $M$ pairs $(u, v)$ satisfies $1 \leq u < v \leq N$ and $A_{u, v} = 1$, meaning that there is an edge connecting node $u$ and $v$.
  \item $A_{u, v} = A_{v, u}$ for all $1 \leq u < v \leq N$.
\end{itemize}

\psection{Input}

The first line contains two integers $N$ and $M$ ($1 \le N, M \le 200\;000$).
The second line contains $N$ integers representing $U$, which is a permutation of $(1, 2, \ldots, N)$.
You are guaranteed that the first element of $U$ is always $1$.

\psection{Output}

If such a graph exists, output $M$ lines, each containing two integers $u$ and $v$ representing an edge that connects node $u$ and $v$.

If there is no such graphs, output \texttt{-1 -1} in a single line.

\exmp{1}{
5 6\\
1 5 2 3 4
}{
1 5\\
2 3\\
5 2\\
4 3\\
3 5\\
4 5
}

\textit{Explanation of Sample 1:} You can also output the following edges and get a correct answer: \\
$(1, 5), (5, 2), (2, 3), (3, 5), (2, 4), (5, 4)$.

\exmp{2}{
5 10\\

}{
-1 -1
}
